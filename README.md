# Mixed-Messages
This is a simple program for generating random inspiring messages.

## Functionality
Uses an object with a set of arrays to display:
  1. Begining of quote.
  2. Centerpeice.
  3. Final bit of wisdom.

A random element is chosen from each of the three arrays and logged to the console. 
Each accompanied by a string message to give the overall message generation more impact.
Originally the project used lists instead of arrays and a more complicated randomizing system but after a little searching this version efficiency really stuck out so I pulled it and edited it accordingly.

### Future Devs
In order to take this project to the next level it would great if a ront end dev could Yassify this project to really enhance the inspirational feel of the project. Thanks in advance.
